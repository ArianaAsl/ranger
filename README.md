<li>And a few more things</li>

<h3> Instructions </h3>
<p> Place all the files and the plugin folder in ~/.config/ranger <br>
  copy the contents of the fonts folder to your fonts directory usually at: /usr/share/fonts or ~/.local/share/fonts <br>
  Use the provided nerd fonts in your terminal of choice if you want icons. You can also use any other nerd font I just happen to like hack <br>
  for image previews in terminal you must have 'ueberzug' or 'w3m' installed. You may have to manually set scope.sh as an executable!<br>
  To do that: chmod +x scope.sh <br>
  I've used ueberzug in my config so that one is enough. <br>
  This is not a super riced bloated crap! Its a minimal sane setup that happens to not look so bad. Enjoy <br>
